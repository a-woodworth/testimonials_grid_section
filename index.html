              I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I
              learned were current, if not more so, in the company I
              joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the
                bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and
                have heard some people who had an amazing experience
                here. I signed up for the free intro course and found
                it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The
                next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time
                of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve
                successfully switched careers, working as a Software
                Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a
                line of code. I needed some structure from
                professionals who can help me learn programming step
                by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
                about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did
                not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never
                had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
                learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
                could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
                during interviews as an example of my developent
                experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
                full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
                100% recommend! ”
